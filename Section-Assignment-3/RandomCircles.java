 * This program draws a set of 10 circles with different sizes,
 * positions, and colors. Each circle has a randomly chosen
 * color, a randomly chosen radius between 5 and 50 pixels,
 * and a randomly chosen position on the canvas, subject to
 * the condition that the entire circle must fit inside the
 * canvas without extending past the edge.
